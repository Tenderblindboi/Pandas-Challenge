	There are a few conclusions that can be made from the given data analysis Charter schools yield a higher overall passing rate than district schools, this is mostly likely due to the difference in funding. Charter schools have a budget from student fees, and thusly can buy more advanced resources for their students. Schools regardless of whether they are district or charter benefit from having a smaller student class size. Schools with bodies up to 2000 students experience rather similar passing performance, but as we go beyond that count the percentage starts to drop.
